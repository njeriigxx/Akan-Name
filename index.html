    <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo,<br> 
       Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth.  <br> 
       For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine <br>
        which name they get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is born. <br>
       According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul. <br>
       The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and  <br>
        organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted <br>
       so many people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a matter of <br>
       fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their <br>
       rank among the siblings just by their names.</p>
